## RIP triplane

Triplane was a real-time, collaborative trip planner. It started out as a hackathon project and later turned into a very involved side project at Expedia. After building it, releasing it to the public, and maintaining it for 3+ years, I decided to lay it to rest as the cost of maintenance no longer made sense given the lack of traction. Rather than let it disappear completely, however, I decided to create this page to proudly showcase the product.
