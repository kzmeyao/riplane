## RIP triplane (2015-2019)

Triplane was a real-time, collaborative trip planner. It started out as a hackathon project and later turned into a very involved side project at Expedia. I built it out of my own frustrations with using tools such as Google Sheets as a collaborative planning tool. Alas, after releasing it to the public through the [ExpediaLabs](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/expedia-debuts-new-expedia-labs-showcase-for-developers-300313862.html) portal and maintaining it for three years, I decided to lay it to rest as the cost of maintenance no longer made sense given the lack of traction. Rather than let it disappear completely, I decided to create this page to showcase a snapshot of it in its final days.

This is the main page for planning a trip. A combination of Pinterest plus Trello. Save stuff from all over the internet and drag and drop your way to a better itinerary.
